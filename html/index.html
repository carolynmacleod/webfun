<h1>Carolyn MacLeod's Home Page</h1>

<p>
This is my home page, created to house my projects, both professional and fun. 
If you're here to see if I can help you out with some programming work, or to see
if I'm a good fit for a job, welcome. 
This web page is very much under construction - but feel free to say hello. 

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
This is me: <img src="me.jpg" alt="a picture of me" height=400><p> 

I studied math (Combinatorics and Optimization) at the University of Waterloo, 
and have a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. I still love
math, and have been working in a variety of roles since then, with some time off
to attempt a PhD that I later abandoned.
<p>
I'm a bit of a tech generalist. My work experience includes some embedded 
programming, a bit of dev ops work, a very little bit of web programming,
and a lot of C/C++. I'm interested in machine learning and any other 
mathematically focused problems, and have always had an interest in formal
methods and proving the correctness of code. While I like a lot of agile,
I like to make sure I'm working on projects where correctness and fitness
for purpose is more important than raw speed. My ideal job involves a lot of
learning, at least a little analytical skills and math. 



<h3>My Skills</h3>
<p>
Requirements Analysis - I like to isolate requirements from


DevOps Skills - I'm very comfortable in a Linux environment, with most experience with Debian.

I have a very basic web programming demo <a href="">here</a>



<h3>3D printing</h3>
<p>
I picked up a <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/">Prusa I3 MK3</a> recently. 
I've been enjoying getting to learn some quirks of 3D printing.

<h3>Me outside of tech</h3>
<p>
I have two children, Ronja and Anders, who take a lot of my time. I volunteer
with the Girl Guides with Ronja, swim semi-competitively with a masters' team,
and play bagpipes, most recently with Peel Regional Police pipe band. I also 
love camping and hiking, and I used to do a lot of sea kayaking. 

I may add some content related to some or all of these areas - I have an interest in
STEM education, and I am always looking for new ways to introduce my love of math and 
science to my kids and their friends.

a bit about my technical learning.
