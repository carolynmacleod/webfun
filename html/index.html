<h1>Carolyn MacLeod's Home Page</h1>

<p>
This is my home page, created to house my projects, both professional and fun. 
If you're here to see if I can help you out with some programming work, or to see
if I'm a good fit for a job, welcome. 
<p>
This web page is very much under construction, as it's a lower priority side project - but feel free 
to say hello. I am available for both full time and contract/consulting work. 

<p>
I can be reached at carolyn . macleod @ gmail . com

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
This is me: <img src="me.jpg" alt="a picture of me" height=300><p> 

I studied math (Combinatorics and Optimization) at the University of Waterloo, 
and have a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. I still love
math, and have been working in a variety of roles since then, with some time off
to attempt a PhD that I later abandoned.
<p>
I'm a bit of a tech generalist. My work experience includes some embedded 
programming, a bit of dev ops work, a very little bit of web programming,
and a lot of C/C++. I'm interested in machine learning and any other 
mathematically focused problems, and have always had an interest in formal
methods and proving the correctness of code. While I like a lot of agile,
I like to make sure I'm working on projects where correctness and fitness
for purpose is more important than raw speed. My ideal job involves a lot of
learning, at least a little analytical skills and math. I'd also like to be 
part of a greater project that I believe in.



<h3>My Skills</h3>
<p>
<em>Requirements Analysis</em> - I like to isolate requirements from implementation, and to take some time 
to really consider if I'm building something because it's the easiest thing to build, and not because it's the 
best solution to the problem. 

<p>
<em>DevOps Skills</em> - I'm very comfortable in a Linux environment, with most experience with Debian.
I have some experience with Docker, AWS instances, git, Jenkins, GitLab, and other tools. I like to use
whatever tools are most appropriate to the job, and am happy to learn new tools when they come out.

<em>Programming Languages</em> - I 


<h3>My Interests</h3>


<h4>Demos</h4>
<p>
I know for programming and technical jobs, establishing skills 

I have a very basic web programming demo <a href="gameoflife.html">here</a> - I've implemented Conways's game of 
life with a pure front end javascript implementation. I don't have any other personal projects to show right now,
but I hope to show some android and python/C++ projects at a later time.



<h3>3D printing</h3>
<p>
I picked up a <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/">Prusa I3 MK3</a> recently. 
I've been enjoying getting to learn some quirks of 3D printing. When I have a moment, I'd like
to show a few of my projects here.

<h3>Me outside of tech</h3>
<p>
I have two children, Ronja and Anders, who take a lot of my time. I volunteer
with the Girl Guides with Ronja, swim semi-competitively with a masters' team,
and play bagpipes, most recently with Peel Regional Police pipe band. I also 
love camping and hiking, and I used to do a lot of sea kayaking. 

I may add some content related to some or all of these areas - I have an interest in
STEM education, and I am always looking for new ways to introduce my love of math and 
science to my kids and their friends.
